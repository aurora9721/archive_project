# TRANSCODING PROJECT

## IMD: FNV/Philips Board Game

> **Feedback 20/02/2020:**  
important when selecting it is the material and form of it, for transcoding  
Think about how you'd document it if it were to disappear  
Facsimile - representative (capturing the form, a copy of it) and interpretative (transcoding its meaning, even if the form/visual language are different)  
What is the meaning of each of your transcodings?  
Make it accessible: myth, video game, physical space, ritual  
What would be the topic(s) that this artefact brings up?
