# TRANSCODING PROJECT

## IMD: FNV/Philips Board Game

> **Feedback 20/02/2020:**  
important when selecting it is the material and form of it, for transcoding  
Think about how you'd document it if it were to disappear  
Facsimile - representative (capturing the form, a copy of it) and interpretative (transcoding its meaning, even if the form/visual language are different)  
What is the meaning of each of your transcodings?  
Make it accessible: myth, video game, physical space, ritual  
What would be the topic(s) that this artefact brings up?

### FNV Game for Promotion during Elections of Works Council of Philips Telecommunication  
**Board game** (1975-1999) 30x43cm   
About Philips Telecommunicatie Industrie (P.T.I.) Hilversum / Huizen  
Made by Industriebond FNV (Federation of Dutch Trade Unions)  
FNV is both a labour union (with different sectors, in this case Industry) and a labour federation (with affiliated independent unions)  
Aim: "Workers' participation", maybe to inform or educate or propose ideas.  
Print on paper, probably not very durable. Lifespan: Seems to have a lot of writing on it, might become impossible to interpret out of context or too far in the future if language were to change.

Dear Aurora,  
As the scan in the catalogue is quite bad, I went into the storage area today and photographed the game board. You can find the photograph in the attachment. 
Since it is all in Dutch, some information on the context: this was likely made to promote the candidate of the FNV (the biggest Dutch trade union federation) in upcoming elections for the Works Council of Philips Telecommunication. It had a stamp on the back saying that it was received in 1984. The various squares on the board all represent different things that could happen at work and which will either give you an advantage or a disadvantage. For example, landing on square 26 (‘You join the FNV’) allows you to move up to square 28, whereas landing on square 15 (‘You have a bad performance review’) will set you back to square 12. A lot of squares are related to the union or the Works Council. The message becomes clearest in the center square, which looks like a small election poster with the words ‘Kies industriebond FNV’ (or: ‘Vote for the FNV Industry Union’) on it. 
I hope this gives you the information you need! 
With kind regards,
