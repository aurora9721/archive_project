## IMD/Coding: FNV/Philips Board Game
### Background Information  
![](/assets/images/Board_game_small.png)  
#### [FNV Game for Promotion during Elections of Works Council of Philips Telecommunication](https://search.iisg.amsterdam/Record/1037521)  
**Board game** (1975-1999) 30x43cm   
About Philips Telecommunicatie Industrie (P.T.I.) Hilversum / Huizen  
Made by Industriebond FNV (Federation of Dutch Trade Unions)  
FNV is both a labour union (with different sectors, in this case Industry) and a labour federation (with affiliated independent unions)  
Aim: "Workers' participation", maybe to inform or educate or propose ideas.  
Print on paper, probably not very durable. Lifespan: Seems to have a lot of writing on it, might become impossible to interpret out of context or too far in the future if language were to change.  

**What is the Aim of this Game?**  
In order to win the game, the player realises they need the support of the FNV.

>>**E-mail**  
Dear Aurora,  
As the scan in the catalogue is quite bad, I went into the storage area today and photographed the game board. You can find the photograph in the attachment. 
Since it is all in Dutch, some information on the context: this was likely made to promote the candidate of the FNV (the biggest Dutch trade union federation) in upcoming elections for the Works Council of Philips Telecommunication. It had a stamp on the back saying that it was received in 1984. The various squares on the board all represent different things that could happen at work and which will either give you an advantage or a disadvantage. For example, landing on square 26 (‘You join the FNV’) allows you to move up to square 28, whereas landing on square 15 (‘You have a bad performance review’) will set you back to square 12. A lot of squares are related to the union or the Works Council. The message becomes clearest in the center square, which looks like a small election poster with the words ‘Kies industriebond FNV’ (or: ‘Vote for the FNV Industry Union’) on it.  
I hope this gives you the information you need! 
With kind regards,

#### The History of the FNV, labour unions in the Netherlands and how they relate to Philips  
The IISG dates this object to sometime between 1975-1999. It was received at the IISG in 1984.
However the FNV as such was only established in 1976, as a joining of the NVV & NKV.
So to understand the history of this object in the context of workers' rights in the Netherlands at the time, I have to search further back than 1976.  

**Setting the scene:**  
During the Second World War, the Netherlands suffers great losses, is exploited as a colony by Nazi Germany (there is large-scale (partly forced) collaboration in the government and industry♦️) and loses its own income from exploiting colonies such as Indonesia (cut economic ties in 1957).  

The Marshall Plan (1948-1952) helps the Netherlands rebuild itself and become a *welfare state*. In 1952, the Netherlands becomes a member of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which is the predecessor of the European Economic Community (EEC) and eventually, the European Union. The Netherlands regains its wealth largely through trade, facilitated by the aforementioned. The late 50's and 60's see a *rise in socialism*.  

**Focus on Workers' Rights [[1]](https://www.blikopdewereld.nl/geschiedenis/nederland/geschiedenis-nederland/1001-geschiedenis-van-de-nederlandse-vakbeweging), [[2]](https://www.vakbondshistorie.nl/tijdbalk-canon/tijdbalk-1975-2000/)**  
Wim Kok is a key figure - he was chairman of the union NVV through the 60's and he became chairman of the FNV when they merged, from 1976 till 1985. At the time, the FNV is the largest trade union in the country. (He later became prime minister as a member of the PvdA (social democratic Labour Party))  

**Bestek '81** were austerity cuts of around 10 billion guilders, 6.7 billion (more than 3 billion Euros) of which were cuts on social security. This triggered **massive protests** particularly from the labour unions, as unemployment continues to increase despite the austerity cuts.    

One of Wim Kok's key achievements in his time as chairman of FNV was the **(Akkoord van) Wassenaar Agreement**, which concluded in 1982 on the following:♦️♦️
- *Wage moderation*, meaning the government restrains the workers' wages and stops their increase in order to stimulate the economy and curb inflation.
- And *shorter working times*. "In the Netherlands, the average working time per employee decreased from approximately 1.800 hours per year in 1970 to 1.430 in 2016." ([Wikipedia 1](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeidstijdverkorting), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomes_policy#The_Netherlands_and_Belgium))
- In exchange for *more employment*.  

> ♦️ Note 1: Philips remained in operation through the Second World War, they had a factory known as Philips-Kommando in Kamp Vught, a Nazi concentration camp near the town of 's-Hertogenbosch. They employed prisioners and offered them protection, saving nearly 400 lives. However, it also has to be noted that Philips remaining open through the war period was key to their survival as a company.  

> ♦️♦️ Note 2: The Wassenaar Agreement also marks the begining of the polder model in the Netherlands. "The polder model (poldermodel) is consensus decision-making, based on the acclaimed Dutch version of consensus-based economic and social policy making in the 1980s and 1990s." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polder_model)) The key characteristic is tri-partite cooperation between 1) employers' organisations, 2) labour unions (like the FNV) and 3) the government.

Set in the 1980's, it tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players' task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty.

[*Quantified*](http://www.jannaullrich.de/popup/portfolio_jannaullrich_201806.pdf) (Janna Ullrich, 2018)  
In this cooperative board game, a player’s behaviour accumulates a social credit score, leaving traces of data behind for governments and corporations to analyse. Players start from different positions on the social ladder – as refugees, unemployed or employed – with unequal access to human rights, in a world in which everyone’s behavior is constantly surveilled and analysed. By gamifying the complex challenges of migration, participants learn through role playing.  

([Progress in Play: Board Games and the Meaning of History](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/progress-in-play-board-games-and-the-meaning-of-history/))  

"The practice of making games to promote clean living and political progress (with that progress always culminating in an image of the government currently in power) persisted all through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. The Soviet Union made particularly good use of board games, though in contrast to the French revolutionaries, who were so keen to have citizens rehearse and internalize the events of the revolution, the Soviets were generally more concerned with making sure that the newly urbanized peasantry learned the basics of health and hygiene. [...] It is little wonder that every variety of moral and political regime has put its stamp on a board game or two. There are few pursuits that so perfectly replicate our attempts to imagine the course of progress, which seems so sensible it ought to be inevitable but is nevertheless subject to chance."

### Transcoding 3  

This game simulates real life, in which the worker's decisions have consequences. These consequences allow you to advance or fall back on the game board, or in your career.  
List of squares and the jumps made when you fall on them:
- 4 -> 8
- 5 -> 3
- 7 -> 12
- **9 -> 6**
- 13 -> 17
- 15 -> 12
- 19 -> 25
- 21 -> 22
- 23 -> 8
- **24 -> 34**
- **26 -> 28**
- 35 -> 39
- **40 -> 3**
- 41 -> 34
- **42 -> 43**
- 44 -> 34
- 48 -> 54
- **53 -> 39**
- 58 -> 6
- 59 -> START
- **61 -> 56**
- 64 -> 46  

Jumps back and forth (consequences) visualised:

After making a decision tree, maybe the natural transition is a system of triggers/events, perhaps in Unity. This is the Unity Manual on [Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent.html) and this is the Scripting API entry on [Events](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html).

### Making a Tool  
A tool that shows the state of workers' rights and the role of the unions today.
I want to use key words such as #workersunion #fnv #unemployment #workhours #wages #socialprotection #paidleave #welfarestate #workersrights ...etc.
With these keywords I want to be able to scan the headlines of several news sources and pick out related articles that contain those terms and therefore relate to the topic.  

***How can I do this?***  
*Using an API?*  
["An API [...] is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses. APIs allow [the user] to complete the action without leaving your website."](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/)  

*A filtered RSS feed?*  
*What's an RSS feed in the first place?*  
"What is RSS?
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication  
RSS allows you to syndicate your site content  
RSS defines an easy way to share and view headlines and content  
RSS files can be automatically updated  
RSS allows personalized views for different sites  
RSS is written in XML"  
-[w3schools: XML RSS](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rss.asp)  

"RSS is a way for website authors to publish notifications of new content on their website. This content may include newscasts, blog posts, weather reports, and podcasts.  
To publish these notifications, the website author creates a text file with the XML file extension for the RSS feed that contains the title, description, and link for each post on the site. Then, the website author uses this XML file to add an RSS feed to web pages on the site. The XML file automatically syndicates new content through this RSS feed in a standard format that displays in any RSS reader.  
When website visitors subscribe to this RSS feed, they read the new website content in an RSS reader. These RSS readers collect content from multiple XML files, organize the information, and display the content in one application." (for source, click on the image below)

### Making a Game  
Upon analysing and breaking down the statements on the board, it became clear that this game is not just about the importance of joining a union, but also implies that you will climb your professional ladder if you do.
The format of the game is very straight forward, it's the **Game of Goose**. The board is formatted in a concentric spiral and it is pretty linear in narrative.

However, I was interested in the **professional ladder** becoming a bigger part of the game. As you play, it is clear it has levels but it isn't visualised on the board. I instantly thought of the game **Snakes and Ladders** (following the train of thought I started in [transcoding 4](#transcoding_4)). This game is made far less linear by the connections and jumps across the grid structure.  

"*When it was originally devised Snakes and Ladders was a moral game with virtues in the shape of the ladders, allowing the players to reach heaven quickly, while the vices, in the shape of snakes, forced the player back down.*"([V&A Museum of Childhood](https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/collections/snakes-and-ladders/))

>Snakes and Ladders is probably based upon a very old Indian game called Moksha-Patamu, played as early as the 2nd Century. L: a Victorian English board. R: a 19th Century Indian version

In order to emphasize the levels, I want to go into the realm of 3D and my main inspiration are Escher's **fantastical architectures** and optical illusions.

**Reformatting the Game**

I divided the squares on the board into 3 levels:  
LEVEL 1: START - 20  
LEVEL 2: 21 - 40  
LEVEL 3: 41 - 65  
There's two connections between each level. To visualise, this is a first sketch. I imagined a tower, with 3 levels that are linked by staircases.

My plan is to build this architectural game in 3D and render frames to eventually have an animation in videos/gifs. They will show the player's position in the tower as they play the game.

However, like in Escher, nothing is at it seems. The levels of the tower are in fact separate planes, to highlight how difficult it can be for an employee to rise through the ranks if the structure is designed to stop them from doing so. That's where the unions can step in and look out for the worker and "level the playing field".

It will be on the background of a text-based game I will build on [**Twine**](https://twinery.org/), by reformatting the linear progression of the statements into a decision tree.

### Feedback Log
> **Feedback 20/02/2020:** *with Martijn*  
important when selecting it is the material and form of it, for transcoding  
Think about how you'd document it if it were to disappear  
Facsimile - representative (capturing the form, a copy of it) and interpretative (transcoding its meaning, even if the form/visual language are different)  
What is the meaning of each of your transcodings?  
Make it accessible: myth, video game, physical space, ritual  
What would be the topic(s) that this artefact brings up?  
*************
> **Feedback 15/03/2020:** *with Hannes*  
Interpretative VS Representational  
Do some more representational transcoding so it becomes more clear where it comes from.  
☑ To contextualise the artifact  
First jumps should maybe be representational, still clear where they come from  
Later jumps can become more abstract  
Maybe first step is to digitise it, cleaned up  
Archiving - documenting. How can someone get a mental image of this artefact without seeing it?  
Check Wikipedia page for an image with all its metadata - How is it structured?  
☑ Research on FNV + Philips specifically  
Get in touch with Vincent, he has nice sketches  
☑ Break down the meaning of the different squares - in digital form w hovers to get some context  
A game is a system, just like a website- a navigation of information (text, video, links, images (like an advent calendar of information))*[THIS IS GOOD TO TALK TO MARTIJN ABOUT- how can the digital tools help you in this process]*  
*************  
> **Feedback 23/03/2020:** *with Martijn*  
☑ Focus of the game: what is the aim? to capture the ideology of the FNV, or the worker's situation?
☑ Bring back the background info and original intention.
☑ Gig economy, deliveroo, airbnb, quarantine + unemployment (what role would unions play in this?)
Consider: emailing the FNV + Philips
*************   
> **Feedback 06/04/2020:** *with Hannes*  
Anyone you can talk to today who has a important role in the FNV?  
To link its relevance to today.  
What is the boardgames position? How do we relate to this in a contemporary way? Both the meaning and the artefact.  
What is the intention behind each transcoding? What media do you feel like working in atm?  
*************   
> **Feedback 20/04/2020:** *with Martijn*  
The tool should be a transcoding and represent the board game  
Originally, it was a tool that should produce a transcoding  
What digital transcoding do you want to make?  
In 2 weeks have a rough version/prototype of the game/tool  
Resolution: Use Twine to take the decision based game to the digital realm. Make the game interactive and make an animated visual for the background.
