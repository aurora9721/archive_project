# TRANSCODING PROJECT

## IMD: FNV/Philips Board Game

> **Feedback 20/02/2020:**  
important when selecting it is the material and form of it, for transcoding  
Think about how you'd document it if it were to disappear  
Facsimile - representative (capturing the form, a copy of it) and interpretative (transcoding its meaning, even if the form/visual language are different)  
What is the meaning of each of your transcodings?  
Make it accessible: myth, video game, physical space, ritual  
What would be the topic(s) that this artefact brings up?

About Philips Telecommunicatie Industrie (P.T.I.) Hilversum / Huizen
Made by Industriebond FNV (Federation of Dutch Trade Unions)
FNV is both a labour union (with different sectors, in this case Industry) and a labour federation (with affiliated independent unions)
Aim: "Workers' participation", maybe to inform or educate or propose ideas.
Print on paper, probably not very durable. Lifespan: Seems to have a lot of writing on it, might become impossible to interpret out of context or too far in the future if language were to change.
