## Artefact: FNV/Philips Board Game

This game is made by Industriebond FNV (Federation of Dutch Trade Unions), specifically aimed at the workers of Philips Telecommunicatie Industrie (P.T.I.) Hilversum/Huizen.   
FNV is both a labour union (with different sectors, in this case Industry) and a labour federation (with affiliated independent unions). The aim of the game is to encourage  "workers' participation", maybe to inform, educate or propose ideas.  
Print on paper and stuck to cardboard, probably not very durable. The amount of writing on it can limit its "lifespan", as it might become impossible to interpret out of context or too far in the future if language were to change.

Printed in black and red on white, the squares are numbered and some contain illustrations. The logo of the Industriebond FNV is repeated throughout.  

## Background Information

**What is the Aim of this Game?**  
In order to win the game, the player realises they need the support of the FNV.

>*"...this was likely made to promote the candidate of the FNV (the biggest Dutch trade union federation) in upcoming elections for the Works Council of Philips Telecommunication. It had a stamp on the back saying that it was received in 1984. The various squares on the board all represent different things that could happen at work and which will either give you an advantage or a disadvantage. For example, landing on square 26 (‘You join the FNV’) allows you to move up to square 28, whereas landing on square 15 (‘You have a bad performance review’) will set you back to square 12. A lot of squares are related to the union or the Works Council. The message becomes clearest in the center square, which looks like a small election poster with the words ‘Kies industriebond FNV’ (or: ‘Vote for the FNV Industry Union’) on it."*

## Context and Research

#### The History of the FNV, labour unions in the Netherlands and how they relate to Philips  
The IISG dates this object to sometime between 1975-1999. It was received at the IISG in 1984.
However the FNV as such was only established in 1976, as a joining of the NVV & NKV.
So to understand the history of this object in the context of workers' rights in the Netherlands at the time, I have to search further back than 1976.  

**Setting the scene:**  
During the Second World War, the Netherlands suffers great losses, is exploited as a colony by Nazi Germany (there is large-scale (partly forced) collaboration in the government and industry♦️) and loses its own income from exploiting colonies such as Indonesia (cut economic ties in 1957).  

The Marshall Plan (1948-1952) helps the Netherlands rebuild itself and become a *welfare state*. In 1952, the Netherlands becomes a member of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which is the predecessor of the European Economic Community (EEC) and eventually, the European Union. The Netherlands regains its wealth largely through trade, facilitated by the aforementioned. The late 50's and 60's see a *rise in socialism*.  

**Focus on Workers' Rights [[1]](https://www.blikopdewereld.nl/geschiedenis/nederland/geschiedenis-nederland/1001-geschiedenis-van-de-nederlandse-vakbeweging), [[2]](https://www.vakbondshistorie.nl/tijdbalk-canon/tijdbalk-1975-2000/)**  
Wim Kok is a key figure - he was chairman of the union NVV through the 60's and he became chairman of the FNV when they merged, from 1976 till 1985. At the time, the FNV is the largest trade union in the country. (He later became prime minister as a member of the PvdA (social democratic Labour Party))  

**Bestek '81** were austerity cuts of around 10 billion guilders, 6.7 billion (more than 3 billion Euros) of which were cuts on social security. This triggered **massive protests** particularly from the labour unions, as unemployment continues to increase despite the austerity cuts.    

One of Wim Kok's key achievements in his time as chairman of FNV was the **(Akkoord van) Wassenaar Agreement**, which concluded in 1982 on the following:♦️♦️
- *Wage moderation*, meaning the government restrains the workers' wages and stops their increase in order to stimulate the economy and curb inflation.
- And *shorter working times*. "In the Netherlands, the average working time per employee decreased from approximately 1.800 hours per year in 1970 to 1.430 in 2016." ([Wikipedia 1](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeidstijdverkorting), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomes_policy#The_Netherlands_and_Belgium))
- In exchange for *more employment*.  

♦️ Note 1: *Philips remained in operation through the Second World War, they had a factory known as Philips-Kommando in Kamp Vught, a Nazi concentration camp near the town of 's-Hertogenbosch. They employed prisioners and offered them protection, saving nearly 400 lives. However, it also has to be noted that Philips remaining open through the war period was key to their survival as a company.*  

♦️♦️ Note 2: *The Wassenaar Agreement also marks the begining of the polder model in the Netherlands. "The polder model (poldermodel) is consensus decision-making, based on the acclaimed Dutch version of consensus-based economic and social policy making in the 1980s and 1990s." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polder_model)) The key characteristic is tri-partite cooperation between 1) employers' organisations, 2) labour unions (like the FNV) and 3) the government.*

In this cooperative board game, a player’s behaviour accumulates a social credit score, leaving traces of data behind for governments and corporations to analyse. Players start from different positions on the social ladder – as refugees, unemployed or employed – with unequal access to human rights, in a world in which everyone’s behavior is constantly surveilled and analysed. By gamifying the complex challenges of migration, participants learn through role playing.

Set in the 1980's, it tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players' task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty.  

[**Progress in Play: Board Games and the Meaning of History**](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/progress-in-play-board-games-and-the-meaning-of-history/)  

"The practice of making games to promote clean living and political progress (with that progress always culminating in an image of the government currently in power) persisted all through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. The Soviet Union made particularly good use of board games, though in contrast to the French revolutionaries, who were so keen to have citizens rehearse and internalize the events of the revolution, the Soviets were generally more concerned with making sure that the newly urbanized peasantry learned the basics of health and hygiene. [...] It is little wonder that every variety of moral and political regime has put its stamp on a board game or two. There are few pursuits that so perfectly replicate our attempts to imagine the course of progress, which seems so sensible it ought to be inevitable but is nevertheless subject to chance."

## Mapping decisions and moves across the board

This game simulates real life, in which the worker's decisions have consequences. These consequences allow you to advance or fall back on the game board, or in your career.  
Below are the jumps forward and backwards (consequences) visualised:
![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/connection_paths_colour.png?raw=true)  

After making a decision tree, maybe the natural transition is a system of triggers/events, perhaps in Unity. This is the Unity Manual on [Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent.html) and this is the Scripting API entry on [Events](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html).

## A worker's manual: do's and don't's

I break down the content of the game and the consequences for specific actions, then list them accordingly: which choices are rewarded and which are punished?

| In the workplace, you'll do well if you: | In the workplace, you'll do badly if you: |  
|--|--|
| Get coffee for your colleagues/your boss | You don't participate in work meetings |
 Take language courses | Your assessments aren't favourable |
 Spend a lot of time with your supervisor | Steal company office supplies |
 Agree with your boss | Your workspace decor is inappropiate |
 Talk about the workers' union during working hours | Hit your boss/colleagues |
 Work overtime and the boss knows | Aren't member of a union so it can protect you in the case of a merger |
 Make your boss a member of a union | Complain about your work |
 Become a union member | Get sick often |
 Show understanding for the management | Let stress get the better of you |
 Have shorter work hours | Aren't member of a union so it can represent and defend your interests when the government introduces new wage measures |
 Have good ideas |
 Vote for the union |
 Get promoted |

## Making a Game: Inspiration

Upon analysing and breaking down the statements on the board, it became clear that this game is not just about the importance of joining a union, but also implies that you will climb your professional ladder if you do.
The format of the game is very straight forward, it's the **Game of Goose**. The board is formatted in a concentric spiral and it is pretty linear in narrative.  

![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/goose_all.jpg?raw=true)  
L: 18th Century Game of Goose. R: Dutch Game of Goose (Ganzenspel) (1916)

However, I was interested in the **professional ladder** becoming a bigger part of the game. As you play, it is clear it has levels but it isn't visualised on the board. I instantly thought of the game **Snakes and Ladders** (following the train of thought I started in [transcoding 4](#transcoding_4)). This game is made far less linear by the connections and jumps across the grid structure.  

"*When it was originally devised Snakes and Ladders was a moral game with virtues in the shape of the ladders, allowing the players to reach heaven quickly, while the vices, in the shape of snakes, forced the player back down.*"([V&A Museum of Childhood](https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/collections/snakes-and-ladders/))

![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/snakes_all.jpg?raw=true)  
Snakes and Ladders is probably based upon a very old Indian game called Moksha-Patamu, played as early as the 2nd Century. L: a Victorian English board. R: a 19th Century Indian version

In order to emphasize the levels, I want to go into the realm of 3D and my main inspiration are Escher's **fantastical architectures** and optical illusions.  

![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/Escher_all.jpg?raw=true)  
L-R, T-B: *Belvedere, Waterfall, Relativity, Ascending & Descending,* and *Tower of Babel* by M. C. Escher.  

![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/escher_game_inspo.jpg?raw=true)  
Contemporary games inspired by Escher's architectural inventions include [Monument Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW2KUxyq8Vg) (2014) and [Echochrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GybxIwfU4rI) (2008), click their respective titles to watch the trailers.  

## Making a Game: Reformatting

I decide to rewrite the game's quite linear narrative into a decision tree where the choices you make take you on different paths. I do this in order to highlight the real "ladder-like" structure of the teachings of the game. If you do X you will succeed (by being a good union member and worker), if you do Y you will not.

I divided the squares on the board into 3 levels:  
LEVEL 1: START - 20  
LEVEL 2: 21 - 40  
LEVEL 3: 41 - 65  
There's two connections between each level. To visualise, this is a first sketch. I imagined a tower, with 3 levels that are linked by staircases.  

![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/game_levels_.png?raw=true)  

## Making a Game: Building

My plan is to build this **architectural game in 3D** and render frames to eventually have an animation in videos/gifs. They will show the player's position in the tower as they play the game on a site.  

![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/game_levels_0003.png?raw=true)  

However, like in Escher, nothing is at it seems. The levels of the tower are in fact separate planes, to highlight how difficult it can be for an employee to rise through the ranks if the structure is designed to stop them from doing so. That's where the unions can step in and look out for the worker and **"level the playing field".**

![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/game_levels_angles.jpg?raw=true)  

It will be on the background of a text-based game I will build on [**Twine**](https://twinery.org/), by reformatting the linear progression of the statements into a decision tree.  

![](https://github.com/aurora9721/archive_project/blob/master/assets/images/game_levels_mockup2.png?raw=true)

The text was made up of short statements on each square. I adapted it into a decision tree format, making scenarios out of the statements and dividing them into 3 levels. Depending on your answers, it is easier or hard to pass on to the next level.  
I write the script separately and then put it into passages on Twine. On Twine, I can style it and give it functions with CSS and Javascript.

In the background, there's a visualisation of the levels of the game (of the professional ladder) as a tower with staircases. A bright spot marks where the player is at the moment, and as they go up levels, the visuals will change accordingly. The clock tower symbolises the workhours, as everything that happens in this game takes place then.

The font of choice is Comic Neue, a new cleaner version of Comic Sans, which I chose based on the fact that the board game is all written out by hand. Every so often, the player might fall into an empty square which just contains the FNV Industriebond logo. I substituted that with "Sponsored Messages" that appear in-between questions.
